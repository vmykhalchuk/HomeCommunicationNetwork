1) we could have retranslator operating with two radio modules
	on SEPARATE FREQUENCY. So Master is on one frequency, Repeater#1 on another and Repeater#2 on yet another
	This would decrease chance of hitting repeater when its bussy sending signal to Master
2) we should implement fuinctionality on constantly monitoring network and selecting best node to talk to

WHY THE FUCK WOULD WE NEED THIS FUNCTIONALITY
WHATS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IT AND STANDARD RETRY MECHANISM???

1) It would guarantee data delivery even if no ACK has been properly returned
2) It would retry after many attempts failed, and will be doing it in controllable way (meaning easy on battery)
3) Will provide most recent data possible (in ordinary setup when ACK failed to be received - but Sender still tries to send old data)
